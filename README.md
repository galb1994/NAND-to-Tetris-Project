# NAND-to-Tetris-Project
A project of building a full-scale computer system.
The course takes a constructive point of view of the computer system and guides you to how to build it step by step.
During this course, we have built different levels of the computer system, each level uses the level below it.
The first part of the course was about implementing logic gates (like NAND, Mux, Xor) and later more complexed chips (like ALU and eventually CPU). Moreover, we have built memory segments that will serve us later on.
In the second part of the course we focused on implementing compilers to different languages. First we have built a compiler from a VirtualMachine language ("push", "pop") to asm (Assembly like). After that we have built a compiler for a high level language to the VM language. In the end we created the mechanism of the high level language, and by that, the whole process was finished.
High level code was translated into VM code, which was translated to asm code, which was translated to binary operation that have been executed by the CPU we have built.
